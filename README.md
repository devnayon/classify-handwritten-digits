This project is a simple yet effective implementation of a **handwritten digit classifier** using the famous **MNIST dataset**. It demonstrates how to train a machine learning model to recognize digits (0-9) from handwritten images.

## 🚀 Features
- 📚 Trains on the MNIST dataset (60,000 training & 10,000 testing samples).
- 🧠 Uses a neural network (or other classifier, depending on your implementation) to achieve high accuracy.
- 📈 Shows loss & accuracy plots to track learning progress.
- 🔍 Predicts digits from new images.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch, if you used that)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
- NumPy, Pandas

## 📦 Installation
Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-digit-classifier.git
cd mnist-digit-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
